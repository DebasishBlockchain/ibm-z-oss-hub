      <h2>IBM Open Source Container Image Agreement</h2>
        These container images are third party offerings made available through this registry as a convenience 
        to Client. Each of these third party offerings are "Separately Licensed Code" (or "non-IBM Product(s) 
        under IBM's Customer Relationship Agreement and Cloud Services Agreement) made available by the third 
        party to Client under the terms of the applicable third party license agreement(s), and not any agreement 
        Client may have with IBM. Client may proceed with downloading the container images if such third-party 
        license terms are acceptable. If these third-party terms are not acceptable, Client may not download 
        or otherwise use or execute the container images.
      
        IBM support of the container images is available only through a separate open source service and support 
        contract. A vulnerability report prepared as a result of a static code analysis may be included in the 
        image posting. No other analysis, certification, testing or verification has been or will be performed 
        by IBM on the images included in the container.
      
        NOTE: With respect to the Separately Licensed Code and any analysis of the code provided by IBM: (a) 
        IBM provides it to Client WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED 
        WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR 
        NON-INTERFERENCE, AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE; and (b) IBM is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, 
        punitive or consequential damages including, but not limited to, lost data, lost savings, and lost 
        profits.

      <p/>
      <span>The images in this registry have several key characteristics:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>The IBM team has built these images from source - they are not assembled from images hosted at other registries.</li>
        <li>For images that include a build test, the IBM team runs these tests, and ensures that the images start as documented. No other tests have been performed.</li>
        <li>These images have been scanned for known vulnerabilities and a report can be seen by clicking on the issues listed under the Security status on the details page for each image.</li>
        <li>The sha256 hash for each image has been published for reference purposes. These hash strings can be comapred after pull to verify image contents.
          Although not required, we recommend using these strings when pulling any of these images.</li>
      </ul>
